Classified-Ads-Script

Simple straightforward PHP script for Classified Ads sites.
It is implemented purely without any un-needed complexity 
and the overkill of any MVC framework and its 
overcomplicated design patterns.

It is all engineered the Noverkill (no-overkill) way :-D
Robust, stable and working as it is since 2004 !!!
