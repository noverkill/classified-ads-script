Classified-Ads-Script

Simple straightforward PHP script for Classified Ads sites.
It is implemented purely without any un-needed complexity 
and the overkill of any MVC framework and its 
overcomplicated design patterns, and all the hassle of 
PSR-s, containers, dependecy injection and inversion of control.
This codes is structural where structural is good enough and OOP
only where it is really needed.
Keep your life simple!

It is all engineered the Noverkill (no-overkill) way :-D
Robust, stable, memory efficient, scalable and working as it is without any major changes since 2004 !!!

(There will be a new implementation based on MVC framework and its design patterns soon if you vote for it :-D)
